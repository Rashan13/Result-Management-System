        <h2>Continuous Assessment and End-Semester Examination</h2>
        <p>
            The performance of each student in each subject module taught during each semester will be evaluated by means of continuous assessment and an end-semester examination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lecturers should assign marks as given below for the continuous assessment component and the end-semester examination component and should announce this weightage at the commencement of the lecture series.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>GPA Calculation</h2>
        <p>
            The Grade Point Average (GPA) of each candidate is calculated using the formula:
        </p>
        <pre>GPA =  Σ(c<sub>i</sub>g<sub>i</sub>) / Σc<sub>i</sub></pre>
        <p>where c<sub>i</sub> is the number of credits and g<sub>i</sub> is the grade point value obtained for the i-th subject module.</p>

        <h2>Minimum Pass Marks</h2>
        <p>
            The minimum pass mark for each subject module is 50% (Grade C). The marks for the entire subject module are the weighted sum of the marks obtained for the two components. The grade point is determined as per the schedule given in the document.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is compulsory that a candidate participates in both the continuous assessment component and the end-semester examination.
        </p>
        <p>
            A candidate with the following marks is deemed to have failed the particular subject module:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Less than 40% for both components (D or E).</li>
            <li>Less than 40% for one component and 40% or above for the other component (*ICA or **IE).</li>
            <li>Being absent with a valid excuse for one component and obtaining less than 40% for the other component.</li>
            <li>Being absent without a valid excuse for one component and obtaining 40% or above for the other component.</li>
        </ul>
